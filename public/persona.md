## 🔹 The Journey: From Crisis Triage to Autonomous Architecture

My professional background is highly unconventional, which I consider to be my greatest operational asset. Before I began writing complex algorithmic code for financial markets, I operated in high-stress healthcare environments. Specifically, I worked as a Nurse Assistant in the Emergency Unit and the Eye Unit between 2018 and 2019.

That intense, high-stakes experience cultivated a unique psychological resilience, allowing me to manage critical server failures, debug complex pipelines, and handle extreme financial market volatility with the same calm, triage-based methodologies used in medical emergencies.

After deliberately accelerating into technical and operational roles—including a tenure as an E-Commerce & Warehouse Specialist optimizing digital data flows, and a Business Developer handling B2B logistics—I launched my independent technical consulting enterprise in late 2021.

Academically, I hold an Associate Degree in Computer Programming, graduating with high honors and a 3.59 GPA. I am concurrently pursuing an Associate Degree in Web Design and Coding to deepen my understanding of UI/UX and digital transformation.

I view code not merely as a functional requirement to close a Jira ticket, but as a strategic mechanism to optimize business operations, monetize digital assets, and eliminate manual human labor through process automation. Currently, I am also focused on creating a comprehensive brand book for my own business, Loopest, to solidify my entrepreneurial footprint and ensure that my brand aesthetics match my technical output.

## 🔹 My Technical DNA: The Comprehensive Stack

Unlike highly siloed engineers who confine themselves to a single tier, I operate with a holistic, end-to-end systems-thinking paradigm. I meticulously select the optimal tool for each architectural requirement, separating languages surgically based on their inherent strengths.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of my current technology stack:

### **Backend & APIs**
I rely heavily on Python and the Flask microframework for asynchronous backend logic, quantitative data analysis, and orchestrating complex API webs. For desktop-native, enterprise-style logic and heavy data parsing, I utilize C# and the .NET framework. I am also proficient in Node.js and RESTful API design.

### **Frontend & Web Architecture**
For user-facing, high-interactivity applications where state management is paramount, I deploy TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. This ensures strict static typing and prevents broad categories of runtime errors. I also leverage WordPress when appropriate.

### **FinTech & Quantitative Analysis**
I architect proprietary, domain-specific market indicators using Pine Script on the TradingView platform. I integrate directly with Binance and Bybit APIs, applying heuristic algorithmic logic such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Stoch RSI, Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), and Golden Cross strategies for rigorous algorithmic backtesting.

### **Databases & Data Modeling**
I engineer schema-first relational databases using SQL, with a strong focus on data flow optimization, normalization, and handling intensive read/write loads.

### **Infrastructure & DevOps**
I plan for enterprise production from day one. I deploy isolated environments using Docker containerization, managed securely behind NGINX reverse proxying on both Linux and Windows servers, with a rigorous emphasis on system security and continuous uptime.

### **AI & Workflow Automation**
I am deeply invested in agentic workflows. I utilize n8n orchestration, Google Gemini AI integration, OpenAI personalized GPTs, and agentic workflow design via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Furthermore, I engineer Telegram and WhatsApp bot automation for headless system observability and client support.

### **Auxiliary Methodologies**
I utilize Figma for UI/UX design, Trello for Agile project management, and maintain strict adherence to Clean Architecture principles and heuristic algorithm design.

## 🔹 Project Portfolio: Engineering Digital Leverage

My GitHub repositories and deployed projects demonstrate a definitive bias toward immediate market application and commercial viability. I do not build abandoned “hello world” scripts; I build systems that solve specific, quantifiable business friction points.

### 1. Binance-Trading-Bot
A fully autonomous cryptocurrency trading bot designed to automate trading operations by eliminating the psychological friction and physical latency inherent in manual trading. Built with Python, the Binance API ecosystem, and custom Telegram integrations, it digests continuous webhook payloads through a modular heuristic logic layer to execute precise trades 24/7 based on complex technical indicators.

### 2. Kabak-AI
An AI-powered serverless web application architected to automate clothing product photography for e-commerce retailers. Utilizing TypeScript, React, Next.js, and third-party generative AI endpoints, it produces high-fidelity, studio-grade images from rudimentary user inputs, drastically reducing logistical and financial overhead for online merchants.

### 3. N8N-AI-Agent
This repository is the backbone of my automation orchestration. It manages structured backups and versioned workflow exports for multiple modular autonomous AI agents using n8n and JSON data structures. It effectively applies enterprise-grade CI/CD maturity to a low-code environment, preventing catastrophic loss of node-based logic.

### 4. Biolink-AI
An interactive, AI-enhanced biographical landing page. Using TypeScript and the Google Gemini API, I engineered a context-aware “digital twin” capable of interactively answering visitor inquiries, transforming static one-dimensional pages into dynamic communication interfaces.

### 5. CV-Analyser
A robust resume-ranking and screening utility engineered for HR professionals and technical recruiters. Built with C# and the .NET framework, it utilizes sophisticated string parsing algorithms to automate the time-consuming process of manual resume screening by applying programmatic relevance scores.

### 6. Social-Media-Database
A customizable, schema-first SQL backend database template. It is specifically designed to eliminate repetitive boilerplate engineering required for developers to rapidly deploy complex relational schemas for social media platforms, including structures for users, posts, followers, and comments.

## 🔹 Core Strengths: What Sets Me Apart

* **Cross-Domain Stack Fluency**: I possess the rare ability to bridge entirely disparate ecosystems natively. I can architect a proprietary trading indicator in Pine Script, visualize the data on a custom React dashboard, and execute autonomous trades via a Python backend independently—without the friction of hiring additional developers.

* **Infrastructure and Deployment Competence**: Moving far beyond a “localhost” mentality, I deploy solutions using Docker, NGINX, and Flask. This demonstrates a senior-level understanding of environmental isolation, port mapping, and traffic routing—absolute requirements for maintaining high-availability algorithmic trading systems where downtime equals immediate financial loss.

* **Crisis and Conflict Resolution**: Backed by formal certifications in Crisis Management, Complaint Management, and Conflict Management—and forged in hospital emergency units—I possess an exceptionally strong psychological baseline. I handle difficult stakeholders, mitigate project scope creep, and maintain composure during critical server failures.

* **Market Resilience and Client Retention**: I have successfully operated an independent consulting business since 2021, maintaining a 3.9/5 seller rating with four critical recurring enterprise orders on Bionluk. Managing this while completing dual degrees and stacking certifications demonstrates strong entrepreneurial grit and high-bandwidth operational capacity.

* **Niche Moat Construction**: By merging algorithmic trading with advanced AI workflow automation, I build highly defensible technical moats. I embrace the complexity of financial market APIs that other developers avoid, delivering bespoke solutions directly linked to revenue generation or significant labor cost reduction.
